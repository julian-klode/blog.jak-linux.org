14 months after applying for the NM process, I'm a Debian Developer.

Thank you everyone (in chronological order):



	  * Daniel Baumann (daniel) - Sponsored my first packages
	  * Joerg Jaspert (joerg) - The first DD who signed my key
	  * Niv Sardi-Altivanik (xaiki) - Advocated me for NM
	  * Martin Zobel-Helas (zobel) - My first AM
	  * Alexander Reichle-Schmehl (tolimar) - The second DD who signed my key (at CeBIT)
	  * Bernd Zeimetz (bzed) - Took over in June, because zobel was very busy
	  * Christoph Berg (myon) - For checking the AM report and requesting the account creation
	  * Jonathan McDowell (noodles) - For adding me to the keyring
	  * Martin Zobel-Helas (zobel) - This time for creating my account

And many thanks to Google - for helping me to find [answers to important questions](http://www.google.com/search?q=Answer%20to%20Life,%20the%20Universe,%20and%20Everything). Without you, I would know nothing. And of course all the others who helped to make this possible.
