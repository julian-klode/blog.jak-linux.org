I just performed some benchmark on Bazaar, Git and Mercurial. This is a very small benchmark, I may publish a more detailed one in a few weeks.

Some notes:



	  1. The unit in the first chart is seconds
	  2. I haven't run git-gc before taking the directory sizes. Running git-gc saves about 1083 kilobytes
