The **installation** was fast and easy, comparable to the installation of Ubuntu.

OpenSolaris seems to have big problems in terms of **wireless LAN**. I am using a WPA/WPA2 encrypted wireless LAN, and it asked to me to enter my passphrase. I entered it, and nothing happened. I was able to get wireless working via commandline, but this lead me to the problem that domain names were not resolved. I could solve this, too. But none of this was permanently, and it should work the graphical way or tell me it does not work. Maybe this whole thing happened because I have a space in the name of my Wi-Fi network.

Another problem is **suspend/resume**, which is not yet working for most laptops; whereas recent Linux distributions support suspend/resume out-of-the-box.

OpenSolaris ships **non-free components**, e.g. NVIDIA display drivers, or Java 6 Update 10. Hopefully, there will be an option in future to install it without this stuff.

Talking about the **desktop**, there is GNOME 2.24 with a custom theme. In my opinion, the theme looks quite good, although I do not like the colours of the minimize,maximize,close buttons of the windows sometimes.

One feature introduced with this release is **Time Slider. **Time slider worked very well, although for  reasons I do not know, I do not really like it. The integration with nautilus is good, but I would still like to see an interface using a calender widget instead of this slider. I remember that the slider sometimes did not work as I expected, e.g. it jumped from left to right.

**The package management** is interesting, but it is to hard to use in my opinion. Debian and derived distributions provide far better package managment in my opinion. Especially the graphical part needs a lot of work in order to compete with Debian.

**The overall speed** was quiet good, and memory usage was 512MB. There is one problem with measuring memory consumption in gnome-system-monitor: I installed netbeans 6.5 and started it, and gnome-system-monitor showed a memory usage of around 20MB, while the program used more than 200MB (according to top).

**All in all**, OpenSolaris gets closer to modern Linux distributions like Fedora 10 or Ubuntu 8.10, but it is not there yet. But with improvements in the area of Wi-Fi and Suspend/Resume,  future releases of OpenSolaris might become a good alternative to Linux distributions, at least if you do not really care about the ideas of free software.
