Just for you, and this time in the Pythonesque rendering.

    
    module main:
        import std (range)
        import std.io (printf, IO)
    
        # print the Fahrenheit-Celcius table for fahr = 0, 20, ..., 300
        function main(mutable IO io):
            Int lower = 0    # lower bound
            Int upper = 300  # upper bound
            Int step = 20    # step
            for Int fahr in range(lower, upper, step):
                Double celcius = 5 * (fahr - 32) / 9
                std.io.printf(io, "%3d\t%6.1f\n", fahr, celcius)


It does not really look like it, but this language is purely functional. It represents side effects using unique types. If you declare a mutable parameter, you basically declare a unique input parameter and a unique output parameter.

Iâ€™m also giving you a list implementation

    
    module std.container.list:
    
        ## The standard singly-linked list type
        type List[E]:
            Nil                     ## empty list
            Node:
                E value             ## current value
                List[E] next        ## remaining list

_And yes, both languages should be able to be represented using the same abstract syntax tree. The only change is the replacement of the opening curly brace by a colon, the removal of the closing curly bracket and semicolons, the replacement of C-style comments with Python-style comments and the requirement of indentation; oh and the for statement gets a bit lighter as well.
