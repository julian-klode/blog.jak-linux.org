Viewing the statistics for my blog, I have come to some conclusions about what topics people are interested in. First let's take a look at the statistics for 1 year:
<table >
<tbody >
<tr >


</tr>
<tr class="alternate" >

<td class="label" >[Short review: Fedora 10 and Ubuntu 8.10](../2008/12/19/short-review-fedora-10-and-ubuntu-810/)
</td>

<td class="views" >2,310
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td class="label" >[A small benchmark: Bazaar, Git, Mercuria](../2008/01/13/a-small-benchmark-bazaar-git-mercurial/)
</td>

<td class="views" >2,112
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="alternate" >

<td class="label" >[Fedora 9 & Kernel Mode Setting](../2008/04/20/fedora-9-preview/)
</td>

<td class="views" >1,804
</td>
</tr>
<tr >

<td class="label" >[Gentoo destroying earth?](../2008/10/10/gentoo-destroying-earth/)
</td>

<td class="views" >1,126
</td>
</tr>
<tr class="alternate" >

<td class="label" >[Filesystems](../2008/12/19/filesystems/)
</td>

<td class="views" >1,093
</td>

</tr>
<tr >

<td class="label" >[Python Speed: 'x in list' vs 'x in set'](../2008/04/29/python-speed-x-in-list-vs-x-in-set/)
</td>

<td class="views" >1,025
</td>
</tr>
</tbody></table>
From these statistics, I conclude that most people are interested in reviews of distributions and benchmarks, as well as stuff directly related to the kernel, eg. filesystems.

Next would be the review of OpenSolaris and other posts, but they have less than 1000 views and are therefore not included in this post. So if you want to get many visitors, just review 2 distributions, do a benchmark of SCMs, or something like this. If you don't want many visitors, don't write about such topics.
