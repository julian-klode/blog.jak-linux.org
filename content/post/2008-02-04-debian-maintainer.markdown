Since yesterday, I am a Debian maintainer. This will help me and my sponsors, which have to do less now.  I can now upload new versions of my packages if the version in unstable contains the "Dm-Upload-Allowed" field in the dsc (and only if the package is not NEW).

For more information about the Concept of Debian Maintainers, see [http://wiki.debian.org/Maintainers](http://wiki.debian.org/Maintainers)

I'm very happy about this, as it makes my life easier. But this does not mean that I don't want to be a DD anymore. A DD is able to vote, to sponsor packages, to upload NEW packages, and many more things. (BTW: I'm currently at T&S step)
