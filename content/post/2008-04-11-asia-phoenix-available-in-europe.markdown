After the reunion of the original Asia lineup in 2006, a tour and the live cd/dvd "Fantasia - Live in Tokyo" in 2007, the super group returns with the first new studio album in 25 years.

For those of you who don't know about them, Asia is a band formed in 1981, including former members of Yes, King Crimson, and Emerson, Lake & Palmer, Uriah Heep, U.K., and The Buggles.

The most popular song of Asia is "Heat of the Moment", from their debut album which spent 9 weeks at number 1 U.S. album chart.

This new album is excellent, featuring songs like the rocker "Never Again" and "Extraordinary Life". A must-have for all Asia fans out there.

The new album will be released in the United States on April, 15 and in Japan on April, 23. It can be bought from [Amazon.com](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00154GEFU/103-6892410-1513430?ie=UTF8&tag=emilink112-20&linkCode=xm2&camp=1789&creativeASIN=B00154GEFU) for $9.99 and in Germany from [Amazon.de](http://amazon.de/gp/product/B0014PAFQE/ref=s9sims_c5_img1-rfc_p_1067275_250858_52959_36824_36563_36601_44166_43745?pf_rd_m=A3JWKAKR8XB7XF&pf_rd_s=center-4&pf_rd_r=1YHB2CH6KCT2TFVBP969&pf_rd_t=101&pf_rd_p=158843291&pf_rd_i=301128) for 15.97â‚¬.
