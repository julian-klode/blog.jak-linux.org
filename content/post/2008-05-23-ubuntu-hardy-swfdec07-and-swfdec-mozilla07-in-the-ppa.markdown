As promised, i have built a few development snapshots of the swfdec git branch for hardy. They are available in my PPA.

To use it, add the following line to /etc/apt/sources.list and install swfdec-mozilla0.7.

    
    deb <a href="http://ppa.launchpad.net/juliank/ubuntu">http://ppa.launchpad.net/juliank/ubuntu</a> <span>hardy</span> main
