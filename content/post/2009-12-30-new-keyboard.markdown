My brother and I just replaced the keyboard of my HP Compaq 6720s with a new HP replacement part (a christmas present). The old one had no characters on some keys anymore and it did not look very well. Replacing the keyboard was a matter of removing two screws, and then just 'clicking' the keyboard out. The old keyboard lost a few keys during the process, but this is not really important anymore. Typing now feels a bit different and I have to get used to it during the next days.

In other news, the defect N900 with QWERTZ keyboard is back to Amazon.de; and I have ordered a QWERTY one on expansys.de yesterday. Let's see when that one arrives.
