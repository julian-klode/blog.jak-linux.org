Dear readers,

I used to blog on [fsfe.org](http://www.fsfe.org/), the website of the Fellowship of the Free Software Foundation Europe. There was one problem that made me switch to [wordpress.com](http://www.wordpress.com/): only Fellows can post comments.

I will write here about my activity in free software projects, like Debian and Ubuntu, and my own software.

I am still working on the categories and will maybe change the style.
