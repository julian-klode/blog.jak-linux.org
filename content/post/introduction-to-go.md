(What follows is an excerpt from my master's thesis, almost all of section
2.1, quickly introducing Go to people familiar with CS)

Go is an imperative programming language for concurrent programming created at and mainly developed by Google, initially mostly by Robert Griesemer, Rob Pike, and Ken Thompson.
Design of the language started in 2007, and an initial version was released in 2009; with the first stable version, 1.0 released in 2012 [^gofaq].

Go has a C-like syntax (without a preprocessor), garbage collection, and, like its predecessors devloped at Bell Labs -- Newsqueak (Rob Pike), Alef (Phil Winterbottom), and Inferno (Pike, Ritchie, et al.) -- provides built-in support for concurrency using so-called goroutines and channels, a form of co-routines, based on the idea of Hoare's 'Communicating Sequential Processes' [^hoare1978communicating].

[^hoare1978communicating]: HOARE, Charles Antony Richard. Communicating sequential processes. Communications of the ACM, 1978, 21. Jg., Nr. 8, S. 666-677.

Go programs are organised in packages. A package is essentially a directory containing Go files. All files in a package share the same namespace, and there are two visibilities for symbols in a package: Symbols starting with an upper case character are visible to other packages, others are private to the package:

```go
func PublicFunction() {
    fmt.Println("Hello world")
}

func privateFunction() {
    fmt.Println("Hello package")
}
```

## Types
Go has a fairly simple type system: There is no subtyping (but there are conversions), no generics, no polymorphic functions, and there are only a few basic categories of types:

1. base types: `int`, `int64`, `int8`, `uint`, `float32`, `float64`, etc.
1. `struct`
1. `interface` - a set of methods
1. `map[K, V]` - a map from a key type to a value type
1. `[number]Type` - an array of some element type
1. `[]Type` - a slice (pointer to array with length and capability) of some type
1. `chan Type` - a thread-safe queue
1. pointer `*T` to some other type
1. functions
1. named type - aliases for other types that may have associated methods:
    ```go
    type T struct { foo int }
    type T *T
    type T OtherNamedType
    ```

    Named types are mostly distinct from their underlying types, so you cannot
    assign them to each other, but some operators like `+` do work on objects of
    named types with an underlying numerical type (so you could add two `T` in the example above).

Maps, slices, and channels are reference-like types - they essentially are structs containing pointers. Other types are passed by value (copied), including arrays (which have a fixed length and are copied).

### Conversions
Conversions are the similar to casts in C and other languages. They are written like this:
```go
    TypeName(value)
```

### Constants

Go has "untyped" literals and constants.

```
    1    // untyped integer literal
    const foo = 1 // untyped integer constant
    const foo int = 1 // int constant
```

Untyped values are classified into the following categories: `UntypedBool`, `UntypedInt`, `UntypedRune`, `UntypedFloat`, `UntypedComplex`, `UntypedString`, and `UntypedNil` (Go calls them _basic kinds_,
other basic kinds are available for the concrete types like `uint8`). An untyped value can be assigned to a named type derived from a base type; for example:

```go
type someType int

const untyped = 2             // UntypedInt
const bar someType = untyped  // OK: untyped can be assigned to someType
const typed int = 2           // int
const bar2 someType = typed   // error: int cannot be assigned to someType
```

## Interfaces and 'objects'
As mentioned before, interfaces are a set of methods.
Go is not an object-oriented language per se, but it has some support for associating methods with
named types: When declaring a function, a _receiver_ can be provided - a receiver is an additional
function argument that is passed before the function and involved in the function lookup, like this:

```go
type SomeType struct { ... }

func (s *SomeType) MyMethod() {
}

func main() {
    var s SomeType
    s.MyMethod()
}
```

An object implements an interface if it implements all methods; for example, the following interface `MyMethoder` is implemented by `*SomeType` (note the pointer), and values of `*SomeType` can thus be used as values of `MyMethoder`. The most basic interface is `interface{}`, that is an interface with an empty method set - any object satisfies that interface.
```go
type MyMethoder interface {
    MyMethod()
}
```
There are some restrictions on valid receiver types; for example, while a named type could be a pointer (for example, `type MyIntPointer *int`), such a type is not a valid receiver type.


## Control flow
Go provides three primary statements for control flow: `if`, `switch`, and `for`.
The statements are fairly similar to their equivalent in other C-like languages, with some exceptions:

* There are no parentheses around conditions, so it is `if a == b {}`, not `if (a == b) {}`. The braces are mandatory.
* All of them can have initialisers, like this

    ```if result, err := someFunction(); err == nil { // use result }```

* The `switch` statement can use arbitrary expressions in cases
* The `switch` statement can switch over nothing (equals switching over true)
* Cases do not fall through by default (no `break` needed), use `fallthrough` at the end of a block to fall through.
* The `for` loop can loop over ranges: `for key, val := range map { do something }`



## Goroutines
The keyword `go` spawns a new goroutine, a concurrently executed function. It can be used with any function call, even a function literal:

```go
func main() {
    ...
    go func() {
        ...
    }()

    go some_function(some_argument)
}
```

## Channels
Goroutines are often combined with channels to provide an extended form of Communicating Sequential Processes [^hoare1978communicating]. A channel is a concurrent-safe queue, and can be buffered or unbuffered:

```go
var unbuffered = make(chan int)  // sending blocks until value has been read
var buffered = make(chan int, 5) // may have up to 5 unread values queued
```

The `<-` operator is used to communicate with a single channel.

```go
valueReadFromChannel := <- channel
otherChannel <- valueToSend
```

The `select` statement allows communication with multiple channels:

```go
select {
    case incoming := <- inboundChannel:
        // A new message for me
    case outgoingChannel <- outgoing:
        // Could send a message, yay!
}
```

## The `defer` statement
Go provides a `defer` statement that allows a function call to be scheduled for execution when the function exits. It can be used for resource clean-up, for example:

```go
func myFunc(someFile io.ReadCloser) {
    defer someFile.close()
    /* Do stuff with file */
}
```

It is of course possible to use function literals as the function to call, and any variables can be used as usual when writing the call.

## Error handling
Go does not provide exceptions or structured error handling. Instead, it handles errors by returning them in a second or later return value:

```go
func Read(p []byte) (n int, err error)

// Built-in type:
type error interface {
        Error() string
}
```

Errors have to be checked in the code, or can be assigned to `_`:

```go
n0, _ := Read(Buffer)   // ignore error
n, err := Read(buffer)
if err != nil {
    return err
}
```

There are two functions to quickly unwind and recover the call stack, though: `panic()` and `recover()`.
When `panic()` is called, the call stack is unwound, and any deferred functions are run as usual.
When a deferred function invokes `recover()`, the unwinding stops, and the value given to `panic()` is returned.
If we are unwinding normally and not due to a panic, `recover()` simply returns `nil`.
In the example below, a function is deferred and any `error` value that is given to `panic()` will be recovered and stored in an error return value.
Libraries sometimes use that approach to make highly recursive code like parsers more readable, while still maintaining the usual error return value for public functions.

```go
func Function() (err error) {
    defer func() {
        s := recover()
        switch s := s.(type) {  // type switch
            case error:
                err = s         // s has type error now
            default:
                panic(s)
        }
    }
}
```

## Arrays and slices
As mentioned before, an array is a value type and a slice is a pointer into an array, created either by slicing an existing array or by using `make()` to create a slice, which will create an anonymous array to hold the elements.

```go
slice1 := make([]int, 2, 5) // 5 elements allocated, 2 initialized to 0
slice2 := array[:]          // sliced entire array
slice3 := array[1:]         // slice of array without first element
```

There are some more possible combinations for the slicing operator than mentioned above, but this should give a good first impression.

A slice can be used as a dynamically growing array, using the `append()` function.

```
slice = append(slice, value1, value2)
slice = append(slice, arrayOrSlice...)
```

Slices are also used internally to represent variable parameters in variable length functions.

## Maps
Maps are simple key-value stores and support indexing and assigning. They are *not* thread-safe.

```go
someValue := someMap[someKey]
someValue, ok := someMap[someKey]   // ok is false if key not in someMap
someMap[someKey] = someValue
```
