Two days ago, I sent my Debian Maintainer application to the debian-newmaint mailing list. Previously, I asked several sponsors if they would advocate me. [malex](http://qa.debian.org/developer.php?login=malex) said yes. Another sponsor, who is also an Ubuntu MOTU, also wrote a bit.

A Debian Maintainer can upload new versions of his packages, if they are not NEW and if the Packages contains a DM-Upload-Allowed field. This would allow me to upload new versions of gnome-app-install or app-install-data, dir2ogg, etc. without needing to ask a sponsor first.

I hope to be accepted as a Debian Maintainer soon.
