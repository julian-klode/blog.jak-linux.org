On Monday, I joined Software in the Public Interest (SPI). I'm currently a non-contributing member and have already applied for contributing membership.

MJ Ray asked [why people do and dont join SPI](http://www.news.software.coop/why-people-do-and-dont-join-spi/14/),Â  and [received answers](http://www.news.software.coop/spi-meeting-tonight-and-why-people-dont-join-spi/44/).

Not knowing SPI is no good reason, at least if you are participating in Debian's development, and you should really know SPI if you are a Debian Developer.

For me, personally, not joining the SPI would not make any sense. The existance of other organizations is no good reason. Look at me, I am also a Fellow of the Free Software Foundation Europe.

There is only one reason which seems to be a bit right: It's hard to join SPI. The membership information is located at 'About -> Membership' in the menu. Maybe this should be made a top-level menu-item and a big link "JOIN!" should be put on the homepage.

I see no reasons for anybody to not [join SPI](https://members.spi-inc.org/). All you need to [join](https://members.spi-inc.org/) is a valid email address and interest in free software.
