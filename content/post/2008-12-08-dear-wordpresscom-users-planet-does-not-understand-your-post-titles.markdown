If you use wordpress.com, and added a Gravatar, always use the Atom feeds for Planet installation. There seem to be some problems with parsing the code, i.e. planet seems to understand media:title from your gravatar in the rss feed as the title of the post (therefore, the title of this post would be juliank).

The URL of the feed is http://juliank.wordpress.com/feed/atom/, replace juliank with the name of your blog.
